The solution involves removing the `!important` declaration and adjusting the CSS selectors to achieve the desired styling using standard CSS specificity rules:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.grandchild {
  color: green;
}

.parent .child .grandchild {
  color: purple;
}

/* Or, for a cleaner solution focusing on the grandchild only*/
.parent .child .grandchild {
  color: purple;
}
```

By removing the `!important` flag, the CSS cascade works predictably. The `.parent .child .grandchild` selector's specificity is sufficient to override the styles from `.parent` and `.child`, resulting in the desired purple color without resorting to `!important`. This approach makes the CSS easier to maintain and debug in the long run.
